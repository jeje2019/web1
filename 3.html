<p>The SendBird SDKs help you to implement real-time chat to any types of
  your client apps with speed and efficiency. Our Unity SDK provides you
  with various methods to initialize, configure and build the chat
  from the client side - no server side implementation is required
  because our reliable infra management service is delivered with the SDK.
  This page presents a brief overview of the SDKâ€™s structure and abilities,
  then lets you go through the preliminary steps of implementing the SDK in your own app.
